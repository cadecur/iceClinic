To run the webapp, create a virtual environment and install requirements.txt. I recommend using conda to install the dependencies and to do so when you create the virtualenv, this is the most surefire way to avoid any dependency conflicts.

To run the webapp, first grab the file `f09_g16.B.cobalt.FRAM.MAY.TS.200005-208106.nc` from the Interns2019 folder on the drive and then run ```bokeh serve .\bokeh_serve.py```.
